# Changelog

## v1.0.0-prod — 2026-05-28
- Production hardening pass on Codex's v0.1-shipped scaffold. Confirmed CI + Pages workflow green on `main` at HEAD before tagging `v1.0-prod`.
- Codex's v2-era scaffold already carries the `## Production status` block, `## Part of the Kinetic Gain Suite` SEO footer, `Monetization ladder` with honest tier wording, and KGE `/embedded` tie-back — confirmed unchanged, no narrative edits.
- Added `ledger.kineticgain.com` to `procurement-pulse-engine/universe.csv` per the v2 "every deploy enters universe" rule.
- No `src/`, README narrative, docs, or screenshot edits — squad doctrine v1.1 respects the v0.1-shipped operator-surface as Codex shipped it.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-05-26

- initial public ship of the Rust clause obligation ledger control plane
- modeled append-only obligation events, review packet readiness, and renewal-safe evidence posture
- static prerendered Pages deployment for `ledger.kineticgain.com`
- Rust validation lane with tests, build, prerender, smoke, and screenshots
